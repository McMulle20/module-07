# module-07

## Description
This program streamlines the process of creating a detailed README, ensuring that all essential information is included for a polished and complete document. 
By installing this code, you'll automate the generation of README files for your projects. 
You’ll be prompted with a series of questions, which will gather key information such as the app’s purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, contribution details, and how to report issues. 
These answers will be used to populate an auto-generated template. Once completed, the README file will be automatically added to your project.
